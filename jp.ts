    Tutorial2:
        "All buildings need power⚡, you have a <em>wind turbine</em> that generates power. You can see your current power supply on the left side of the top bar.<br><br>You might have noticed that wind turbines only work <em>80%</em> of the time. You can consider building other types of power plants that generate stable power.",
    Tutorial3:
        "You have a lot of <em>resource deposits</em> on the map. To extract resources, you have to build mines⛏️ <em>on top of</em> the corresponding deposit.<br><br>For example, you have an <em>oil well🛢️</em> that extracts <em>oil</em> from an oil deposit.<br></br>Resource deposits are unlimited - no need to worry about them running out. Apart from mines, other buildings can be built on any empty tile.",
    Tutorial5:
        "To make money, you need to export your resources via the trade center. To do this, simply turn on <em>auto sell</em> for that resource.<br></br>You can also buy resources from the trade center as well. Remember <em>if you buy a resource, you will drive up the price</em> and if you sell a resource, you will drive down the price.<br><br>The market is <em>volatile</em> and the price📈 changes regularly.",
    Tutorial6:
        "To build new buildings, you need to unlock it first in the <em>research lab🧪</em>. The research lab also converts science to research points.<br><br>Your wind turbine (and other power plants) produces a small amount of science when running. And you can build school🏫 and other dedicated buildings to boost science later.<br><br>Now you have learned all the basics, start to build up your economy! Here are some <em>cash💸</em> and <em>petrol⛽</em> to give you a jump start.",
